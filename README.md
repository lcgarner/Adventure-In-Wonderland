# Adventure-In-Wonderland
 
1. What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
My approach to the project was to do some creative writing/journaling to come up with ideas, then check my ideas with my partners, and then code. I find that my code always turns out best when I plan ahead. 

2. What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
I learned how to use printSlow() and command. In general, I also learned how to create a Zork-like interface. 

3. Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
I wish I had based the Cheshire Cat’s hints on the character’s location on the map; it would have been a smarter way to do it. I plan to continue working on this project, and this is definitely a change I will be making. 

4. If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
   If I had additional time, I would do graphics. I think the world we created is so crazy and fun; it would be a very fun project to add a more exciting visual element. I would also work more on TulgeyWoods. I have some commented code there from working on it, but right now it is a very simple class. 
   
5. What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
While I was working on the FungiForest class, Liberty suggested that I make a chatbot similar to one of our homeworks. This was really good advice because it gave me the inspiration to put my own twist on a skill I learned earlier on in the year. 

6. If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
I would remind myself to use inheritance. We had lots of repeat code at the beginning. Once we started using inheritance, I feel like our work really started to come together.

7. If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
I worked with Liberty Lehr and Nathalie Trouba. I feel like we worked well together. We were all very communicative and excited to work on this project. It was nice to work in a group because we could make a bigger game. We could program together in sessions but also on our own. Occasionally, especially towards the end of finals, it was difficult to find times to meet, but again, we were very communicative and made it work.
