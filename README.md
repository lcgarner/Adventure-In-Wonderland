Reflection: Liberty Lehr

What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
    In the past I learned that projects which start simply and can be expanded upon are generally the most successful. 
Programming an exploration game gives the developer the option to code many different games and therefore practice a 
variety of techniques. Using Alice and Wonderland as a model inspired us to create adaptations to our childhood icons.

    The game operates through class Wonderland which has the character and all of the places created. This construction
allows character to be an attribute for each place.

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    I learned how to incorporate functions that use time to create movement in the code by sleeping or pausing the 
program for a specific amount of nano or milliseconds. I also had an opportunity to utilize a 2d array for the first 
time. 

Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
    There are a fwe examples throughout the game where there are multiple of the same method. Specifically the userAction method
because there are certain action words that are specific to a certain place. I think, if I had more time I would figure out a way
to call a generic method and then if the program cannot find the generic key word it would search for keywords specific to the 
place. The issue with this idea comes if they cannot find a generic method it will have to print out something like, 'I do not know 
that keyword,' and then it would check for the more specific key words and complete those actions. One way to fix this could be to 
overload the method, but that will not reduce the amount of code or make the code more efficient for the game at this size.

    Additionally I wish that I had more time to implement a mini game for each section of the 2d array called map. My group was very 
busy so I ended up doing the bulk of the project (check contributions in the projects read.me). Therefore I did not have enough time
to implement everything that I wanted to as I was busy either fixing Nathalie's bugs or making sure that the game loop worked.

If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
    I would love to create graphics to compliment the story line and make the game more engaging overall. I wanted to 
make a game where you can design a hat for the queen. I also wanted to make specific story lines for certain character 
options. Lily wants to increase the scope of the Cheshire cat, to make the character into a guide for the game.

What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    I think it was most helpful to watch as people played the game and take note of where they seemed to struggle. For 
example, I asked my friend, Emma, to play the game and noticed that her eyes glazed over with the larger blocks of text. This 
observation lead me to create the function for printing text one character at a time, and inspired me to decide to experiment
with graphics over the break.

If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
    I would suggest we draw out the objects and relationships on paper with low stakes to encourage brainstorming. 
I would also tell myself to write out expectations of work for each group member and put it onto a schedule, so that 
other group members could see how their latency affects other people's ability to produce code.

If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
    At first it was very difficult, I often work with Nathalie and she has a lot of trouble understanding coding concepts. 
She does not ask for help when she is having trouble understanding code and instead waits, despite reminders, until someone 
else fixes or completes her work. This made it really difficult for me and Lily to complete all of the mini games 
and do graphics like we originally wanted. Since I have had this issue with her many times before instead of doing her work 
entirely in the group project I decided to only debug her code so that it will run without error. As you can see class Croquet
is quite inefficient despite me fixing the most glaring issues. I decided to make a document to record the contributions to 
the project. The document was available to the entire group and therefore approved by each group member.

    Lily and I have since decided to continue working on perfecting this project over the break. We are both
enjoying the creative adaptation immensely. I was thinking that we should change the them of alice and wonderland from 19th 
century children's fantasy to a futuristic cyber version of wonderland.
