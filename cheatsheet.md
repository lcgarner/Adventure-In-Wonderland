Welcolme to your Adventure in Wonderland!

An interactive/choose-your-own-adventure/text-based game based off Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carrol.

The gameplay is fairly simple. (If you have ever played Zork, then this style will feel very familiar.) Using commands the game allows the user to explore wonderland. The object of the game is to attempt to get out, but also to enjoy all the adventures along the way. You have never been to wonderland before so you may get lost, but if you are good at riddles you will always find your way. The game operates based on a map that is a five by five array, eventually every location on the map will contains several key verbs and key objects, and when the user correctly inputs these key words (based on prompts from the console), the next sequence of events is triggered.

It is meant to be a bit of a guessing game, which is why there is no penalty for being wrong or getting stuck. If nothing happens when you enter a command, you can re-try as many times as you like. Look for hints in the prompts and make sure you spell everything correctly.

To get started on your exploration we will provide some of the key comand words:
 - "take"
 - "drop"
 - "eat"
 - "drink"
 - "go" + "west" (you can use any direction)
 - "clue" (will provide hints on action words)

*Remember to read the text to find the objects.

Beware, you will die and the game will be terminated your health drops below 0 so be sure to eat, sleep, and drink when you can. Additionaly you do not start the game with 100 health points.

To check your health and inventory at any point use these key words:
 - "check" + "inventory" or "health"
