Welcome to Adventure in Wonderland!

An interactive/choose-your-own-adventure/text-based game based off Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carrol.

The gameplay is fairly simple. (If you have ever played Zork, then this style will feel very familiar.) The game operates based on user input. Almost every location on the map contains several key verbs (e.g. take/sleep/eat) and key objects (e.g. knife/pill/jam), and when the user correctly inputs these key words (based on prompts from the console), the next sequence of events is triggered.

It is meant to be a bit of a guessing game, which is why there is no penalty for being wrong or getting stuck. If nothing happens when you enter a command, you can re-try as many times as you like. Look for hints in the prompts and make sure you spell everything correctly.

Beware, the game ends if your health drops below 0.
